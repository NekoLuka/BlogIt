# Introduction
Welcome to BlogIt, a simple opensource framework to create a simple blog.

We have a simple blogging system thanks to [Francesco Maida](https://github.com/fmaida).
We also have a great theme thanks to [Chris Simpkins](https://github.com/chrissimpkins).
Both of their repositories are licensed under the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).  
Here are the links to the repos:

- [Cinder](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/cinder)
- [MkDocs blog plugin](https://github.com/fmaida/mkdocs-blog-plugin)

This work however is licensed under the [GPL-3.0 License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/), meaning that
changes to this repository must be made public and not be hidden behind closed source.

This is because we believe that software should be open for everyone to use and inspect.
